# Qwertickle fork notes
Forked from https://github.com/aitjcize/Qwertickle

This fork substitutes the typewriter sound scheme with a keyboard sound scheme. Better sounds are still wanted :)

Also this version handles both KeyPress and KeyRelease events.

Current sounds are stolen (an sliced afterwards) from similar project: https://github.com/colszowka/linux-typewriter
which states that the sounds extracted from 'keyboard-typing' by Anton at Freesound, www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=137
